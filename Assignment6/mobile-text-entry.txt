MacKenzie and Soukoreff (2002) first present a quick overview of mobile computing in general and define pen-based input and keyboard-based input as the two competing paradigms for mobile text input. Oftentimes, user needs are not met by the current input techniques, and the creation and evaluation of new input devices is an important part of the research in that area. Relevant factors for methodologies for evaluating mobile text entry are mostly text creation vs text copy, the performance of novice versus expert users, speed, accuracy and the comparison of quantitative and qualitative factors.
MacKenzie and Soukoreff then introduce and present models for the two main optimisation techniques for mobile text entry tasks. Movement minimisation tries to minimize the finger or pen movement when a user must input text in a mobile device. Language prediction tries to predict the user’s intended words through his current letter input.
After that, they present an overview of text entry techniques, where they start with key-based text entry techniques. Those include the standard 12-key telephone keypad with the multi-tap method, as well as the two-key method and the ‘one-key with disambiguation’ method. They then talk about the usage of small QWERTY-Keyboards in the mobile context, of their variations and of approaches to reduce their size. They then present the five-key text entry method and give an overview over other small keyboards.
They then present stylus-based text entry, where the user uses a pointing device, like a pen, to select characters through gestures or direct selection. They bring up handwriting recognition as a traditional approach, as well as Unistrokes as a stylised single-stroke alphabet. They then discuss gesture-based text input with the cirrin and the quikwriting technology as examples, and then present possible arrangements for built-in soft keyboards and briefly mention the reactive keyboard as a predictive input technique.
